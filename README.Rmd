## basic example code

data(cells)
cells <- select(cells, -case)
names(cells)[1] <- 'Label' # when use your own data, make sure the first column is your target label, and named it with 'Label'

a_recipe <- recipe(Label~., data = cells) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_anova(all_predictors(), options = list(p_thresh = 0.05)) %>% 
  step_mrmr(all_predictors(), options = list(num_feature = 30))

```
